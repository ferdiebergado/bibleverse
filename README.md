## Deployment

Build the app.

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The build output will be placed at the `dist` folder. You may deploy this folder to any of your preferred platforms.

## Testing the App Locally

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running npm run preview command.

```bash
pnpm run preview
```

This will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from the `dist` folder at http://localhost:4173.
